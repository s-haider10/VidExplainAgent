  "text": "When the electron double-slit experiment is slowed down, individual electrons are sent one at a time. The video shows small green dots (electrons) launched singly.\n\nEach electron passes through a slit and hits the second wall at a single point. However, as more individual electrons hit over time, they gradually accumulate to form the same distinct vertical interference pattern seen with many electrons.\n\nThis leads to the astounding conclusion that each individual electron interferes with *itself*, demonstrating its wave-like nature even when no other particles are present.",
