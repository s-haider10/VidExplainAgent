Fuzzy dark matter is a hypothetical particle studied as a possible explanation for the universe's missing mass, known as dark matter.

This particle is incredibly tiny, far smaller than an electron. Its minute size means it possesses an enormous wave nature, spanning the size of entire galaxies.

Researchers like Luna Zagorac use simulations to study how this galactic-scale wave might be observable.
