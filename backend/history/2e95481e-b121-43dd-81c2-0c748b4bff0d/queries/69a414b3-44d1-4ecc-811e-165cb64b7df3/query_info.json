      "raw_visuals": "Katie Mack is speaking to the camera. As she mentions light acting like a particle and wave, the background equations become more distinct. When she speaks of light bouncing, she claps her hands together once. When she mentions bending and spreading out, she spreads her hands outwards. A quick cut shows a close-up of a hand holding a small, clear prism. A beam of yellow light enters the prism from the left, and as it exits, it splits into a spectrum of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) fanning out to the right. The background behind her is still the dark wall with chalk-like equations",

Even something we think of as an individual object like an electron, has an essential wave-like nature and acts as a wave when it's moving through space. The particle nature only appears when it's observed or measured. On the quantum scale though, for very small particles, that essential waviness fundamentally changes how particles interact with each other, and it means we have to develop new ways to think about and work with the subatomic world. And in some cases, particles acting like waves can change the face of the cosmos itself",
