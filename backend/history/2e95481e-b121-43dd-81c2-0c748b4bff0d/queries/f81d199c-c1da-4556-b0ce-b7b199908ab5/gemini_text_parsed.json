  "text": "Katie Mack defines diffraction as the bending of light around sharp object edges or the patterns light creates when passing through narrow gaps.\n\nThis phenomenon helps demonstrate light's wave nature. In the double-slit experiment, laser light passes through two slits and spreads out like a wave, with the emerging waves interfering with each other to form patterns.",
