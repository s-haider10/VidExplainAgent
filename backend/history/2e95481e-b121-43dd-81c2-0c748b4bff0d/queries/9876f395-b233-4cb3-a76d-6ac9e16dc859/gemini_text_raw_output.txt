The crux of wave-particle duality is that individual objects, like electrons, possess an inherent wave-like nature when in motion. Their particle nature only appears upon observation or measurement.

This fundamental waviness changes how very small particles interact. It means we must develop new ways to understand the subatomic world, and in some cases, this wave-like behavior can even influence the cosmos. The video shows Katie Mack using hand gestures as she explains this concept.
