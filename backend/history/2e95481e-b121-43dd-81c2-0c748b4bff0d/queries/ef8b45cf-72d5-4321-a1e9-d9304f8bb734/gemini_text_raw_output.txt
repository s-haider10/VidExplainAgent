The video visually demonstrates light's wave-like property by showing a beam of yellow light passing through a prism.

As the light exits the prism, it bends and spreads out, fanning into a spectrum of colors. These colors include red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple, showing how light waves can disperse.
