  "text": "The surprising consequence of the extremely small size of the particle Luna Zagorac studies is that its wave nature becomes enormous.\n\nThis particle, called fuzzy dark matter, is significantly smaller than an electron. Due to its tiny size, its associated wave is immense, stretching to the size of galaxies. Luna Zagorac studies this massive wave through simulations as a potential explanation for dark matter.",
