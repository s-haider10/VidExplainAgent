According to Katie Mack, light can act like both a particle and a wave.

Light shows its particle nature by bouncing off a mirror. It displays its wave nature by bending and spreading, for instance, when a beam passes through a prism and splits into different colors.

This dual behavior is a core concept of wave-particle duality.
