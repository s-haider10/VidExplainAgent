But over time, you'll see that the same interference pattern appears, even though no other electrons were passing through at the time to create interference. Apparently, each electron is actually interfering with itself",

      "raw_visuals": "The animated black chalkboard with the double-slit setup returns. This time, individual small green dots (electrons) are shown being launched one by one from the left. Each electron passes through either the top or bottom slit and hits the second wall as a single green dot. Initially, the dots appear randomly distributed. As more and more individual electrons hit the wall over time, the scattered green dots gradually accumulate to form the distinct vertical interference pattern seen before \u2013 dense central band, flanked by less dense bands, separated by sparse regions. This pattern, composed of discrete hits, is enclosed within a white rectangular chalk outline. The animation emphasizes that even solitary particles create the wave-like pattern"

A quick cut shows a close-up of a hand holding a small, clear prism. A beam of yellow light enters the prism from the left, and as it exits, it splits into a spectrum of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) fanning out to the right.
