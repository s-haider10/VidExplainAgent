  "text": "You can't blame a baseball's wave nature for a strikeout because its wavelength is far too small.\n\nWhile all objects, including baseballs, have an unobservable wave nature, the baseball's wavelength is much smaller than even a proton. This makes its wave effects imperceptible and negligible in everyday events, like a fastball missing the strike zone.",
