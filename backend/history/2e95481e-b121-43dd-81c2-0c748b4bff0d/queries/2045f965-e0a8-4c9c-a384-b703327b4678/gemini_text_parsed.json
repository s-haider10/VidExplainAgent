  "text": "The video visually demonstrates light's wave-like property by showing a beam passing through a prism. A yellow light beam enters a clear prism and, as it exits, it bends and spreads out.\n\nThis action causes the light to split into a fanning spectrum of colors, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. This bending and spreading, known as refraction and dispersion, are key characteristics of waves.",
