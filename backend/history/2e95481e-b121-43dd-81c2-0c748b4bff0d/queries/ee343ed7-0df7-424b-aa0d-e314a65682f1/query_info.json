When she speaks of light bouncing, she claps her hands together once. When she mentions bending and spreading out, she spreads her hands outwards. A quick cut shows a close-up of a hand holding a small, clear prism. A beam of yellow light enters the prism from the left, and as it exits, it splits into a spectrum of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple) fanning out to the right. The background behind her is still the dark wall with chalk-like equations",

      "raw_transcript": "This is the crux of wave-particle duality. Even something we think of as an individual object like an electron, has an essential wave-like nature and acts as a wave when it's moving through space. The particle nature only appears when it's observed or measured. On the quantum scale though, for very small particles, that essential waviness fundamentally changes how particles interact with each other, and it means we have to develop new ways to think about and work with the subatomic world. And in some cases, particles acting like waves can change the face of the cosmos itself",

      "raw_visuals": "Katie Mack describes diffraction and the double-slit experiment. The scene cuts to an animated black chalkboard. On the left, a yellow light beam shines towards a white vertical wall with two narrow horizontal slits. The light passes through the slits, and circular yellow waves emanate from each slit, expanding outwards and overlapping. The waves interfere with each other, creating a complex pattern of intersecting arcs. These waves then hit a second white vertical wall on the right. On this second wall, a vertical pattern of alternating bright yellow and dark bands appears, representing the interference pattern. The central band is the brightest and widest yellow, flanked by progressively dimmer and narrower yellow bands, separated by dark bands. This entire pattern is enclosed within a white rectangular chalk outline",

      "raw_transcript": "One way to see the wave nature of light is through diffraction, the way that light bends around the sharp edges of objects or creates patterns when passing through narrow gaps. In the double slit experiment, laser light passes through two slits in a wall and spreads out like a wave as it passes through. The waves coming from each slit interfere with each other, creating a pattern of light and dark spots on a wall on the other side. This happens because when two crests or two troughs of a wave meet, they add together, but when a crest and a trough meet, they cancel out",
