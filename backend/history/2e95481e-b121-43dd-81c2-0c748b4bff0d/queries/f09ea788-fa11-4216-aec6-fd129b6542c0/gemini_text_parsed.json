  "text": "The video displays an animated diagram on a black chalkboard. A yellow light beam shines towards a white wall with two narrow slits.\n\nAs the light passes through, circular yellow waves spread out from each slit, expanding and overlapping. These waves then hit a second white wall, forming a vertical pattern of alternating bright yellow and dark bands due to interference.",
