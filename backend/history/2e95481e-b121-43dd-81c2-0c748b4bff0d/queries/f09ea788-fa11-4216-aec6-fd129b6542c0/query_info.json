      "raw_visuals": "Katie Mack describes diffraction and the double-slit experiment. The scene cuts to an animated black chalkboard. On the left, a yellow light beam shines towards a white vertical wall with two narrow horizontal slits. The light passes through the slits, and circular yellow waves emanate from each slit, expanding outwards and overlapping. The waves interfere with each other, creating a complex pattern of intersecting arcs. These waves then hit a second white vertical wall on the right. On this second wall, a vertical pattern of alternating bright yellow and dark bands appears, representing the interference pattern. The central band is the brightest and widest yellow, flanked by progressively dimmer and narrower yellow bands, separated by dark bands. This entire pattern is enclosed within a white rectangular chalk outline",

      "raw_transcript": "One way to see the wave nature of light is through diffraction, the way that light bends around the sharp edges of objects or creates patterns when passing through narrow gaps. In the double slit experiment, laser light passes through two slits in a wall and spreads out like a wave as it passes through. The waves coming from each slit interfere with each other, creating a pattern of light and dark spots on a wall on the other side. This happens because when two crests or two troughs of a wave meet, they add together, but when a crest and a trough meet, they cancel out",

Small green dots, representing electrons, are shown moving from the left towards the first white wall with two slits. Some electrons pass through the upper slit, some through the lower. As they pass through, they spread out like waves. On the second white wall on the right, the green dots accumulate over time, forming a vertical pattern of dense and sparse regions, mirroring the light interference pattern previously shown. The central vertical band has the highest density of green dots, flanked by less dense bands, separated by sparse regions. This visually demonstrates the wave-like behavior of particles",

      "raw_transcript": "But what if instead of laser light, you throw particles at the wall? If you have a powerful electron beam, you can see that instead of two spots directly behind the slits, or randomly distributed spots, an interference pattern will appear, just like with the light. The electrons are behaving like waves and interfering with each other",

Each electron passes through either the top or bottom slit and hits the second wall as a single green dot. Initially, the dots appear randomly distributed. As more and more individual electrons hit the wall over time, the scattered green dots gradually accumulate to form the distinct vertical interference pattern seen before \u2013 dense central band, flanked by less dense bands, separated by sparse regions. This pattern, composed of discrete hits, is enclosed within a white rectangular chalk outline. The animation emphasizes that even solitary particles create the wave-like pattern",

But over time, you'll see that the same interference pattern appears, even though no other electrons were passing through at the time to create interference. Apparently, each electron is actually interfering with itself",
