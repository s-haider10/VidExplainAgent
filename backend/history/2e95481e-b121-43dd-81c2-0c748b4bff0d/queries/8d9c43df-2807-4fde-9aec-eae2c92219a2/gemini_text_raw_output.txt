Luna Zagorac studies fuzzy dark matter, a hypothetical particle that is incredibly small—far tinier than an electron.

The surprising consequence of its minuscule size is that its associated wave is enormous. This wave is so vast it can extend to the size of entire galaxies, making it potentially observable. Luna investigates this wave-like nature through simulations.
