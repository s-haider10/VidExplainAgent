The scene cuts to an animated purple background. A small yellow oval labeled 'ELECTRON' appears on the left. Then, a large white baseball with red stitching appears on the right, much larger than the electron. The scene shifts, and the yellow 'ELECTRON' is now on the right, significantly larger, and a tiny green dot labeled 'FUZZY DARK MATTER (HYPOTHETICAL)' appears on the left, dwarfed by the electron. The scene returns to Luna Zagorac, who continues to gesture. The large screen behind her shows an image of a complex, symmetrical pattern with swirling yellow, orange, and pink hues, indicative of a scientific simulation. A small vertical color bar on the right side of the image displays a gradient from deep purple to bright yellow, with numeric labels indicating scale",

      "raw_transcript": "All particles have a wave nature, which is super convenient for me, because the particle that I study is super, super small. If you can try to envision how much smaller an electron is than a baseball, my particle is that much smaller than an electron. This means that its wave is huge, enormous, on the size of galaxies. So it's something that would actually be visible, and that's exactly what I study in my simulations of fuzzy dark matter, which is one possible explanation of dark matter, this mystery of missing mass in our universe"

As more and more individual electrons hit the wall over time, the scattered green dots gradually accumulate to form the distinct vertical interference pattern seen before \u2013 dense central band, flanked by less dense bands, separated by sparse regions.

Even something we think of as an individual object like an electron, has an essential wave-like nature and acts as a wave when it's moving through space. The particle nature only appears when it's observed or measured. On the quantum scale though, for very small particles, that essential waviness fundamentally changes how particles interact with each other, and it means we have to develop new ways to think about and work with the subatomic world. And in some cases, particles acting like waves can change the face of the cosmos itself",

On the second white wall on the right, the green dots accumulate over time, forming a vertical pattern of dense and sparse regions, mirroring the light interference pattern previously shown. The central vertical band has the highest density of green dots, flanked by less dense bands, separated by sparse regions. This visually demonstrates the wave-like behavior of particles",
