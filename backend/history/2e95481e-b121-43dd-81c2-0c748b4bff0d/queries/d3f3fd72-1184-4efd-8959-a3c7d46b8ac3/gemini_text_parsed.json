  "text": "Fuzzy dark matter is a hypothetical particle proposed as a possible explanation for dark matter, the universe's missing mass.\n\nThis particle is described as incredibly small, far tinier than an electron. Due to its minute size, its associated wave nature is enormous, spanning the scale of galaxies.\n\nThis large wave means it could be observable. Researchers study fuzzy dark matter in simulations to understand its potential role in cosmology.",
