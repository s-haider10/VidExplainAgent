The animation visually represents a "fuzzy dark matter" particle as a tiny green dot labeled "FUZZY DARK MATTER (HYPOTHETICAL)."

This green dot is shown on the left side of the screen, dwarfed by a significantly larger yellow oval on the right, labeled "ELECTRON." This illustrates that the hypothetical fuzzy dark matter particle is far, far smaller than an electron.
