      "raw_visuals": "Luna Zagorac speaks, using broad hand gestures to emphasize the scale. She stretches her arms out wide when describing the 'huge' wave. The scene cuts to an animated purple background. A small yellow oval labeled 'ELECTRON' appears on the left. Then, a large white baseball with red stitching appears on the right, much larger than the electron. The scene shifts, and the yellow 'ELECTRON' is now on the right, significantly larger, and a tiny green dot labeled 'FUZZY DARK MATTER (HYPOTHETICAL)' appears on the left, dwarfed by the electron. The scene returns to Luna Zagorac, who continues to gesture. The large screen behind her shows an image of a complex, symmetrical pattern with swirling yellow, orange, and pink hues, indicative of a scientific simulation. A small vertical color bar on the right side of the image displays a gradient from deep purple to bright yellow, with numeric labels indicating scale",

If you can try to envision how much smaller an electron is than a baseball, my particle is that much smaller than an electron. This means that its wave is huge, enormous, on the size of galaxies. So it's something that would actually be visible, and that's exactly what I study in my simulations of fuzzy dark matter, which is one possible explanation of dark matter, this mystery of missing mass in our universe",
