Katie Mack explains that light can act like both a particle and a wave.

As a particle, light can bounce, like off a mirror. As a wave, it can bend and spread out, creating a spectrum of colors when passing through a prism. Light waves can also interfere with each other, forming patterns of light and dark spots.
