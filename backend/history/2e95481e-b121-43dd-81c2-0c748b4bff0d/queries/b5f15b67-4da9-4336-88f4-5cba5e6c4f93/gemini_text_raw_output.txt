The double-slit experiment with light concludes that light behaves like a wave, creating an interference pattern of alternating bright and dark bands. The video shows yellow light waves spreading and interfering to form this pattern.

When individual electrons are sent through, the experiment reveals they also behave like waves. The video depicts individual green dot electrons hitting a wall, gradually building up the same interference pattern over time, even when sent one by one.

This implies each electron interferes with itself, demonstrating the wave-particle duality of matter at an individual particle level, unlike light waves interfering with each other.
