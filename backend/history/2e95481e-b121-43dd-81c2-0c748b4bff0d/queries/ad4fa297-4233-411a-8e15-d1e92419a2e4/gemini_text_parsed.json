  "text": "The video displays an animated diagram on a black chalkboard, illustrating the double-slit experiment with light.\n\nOn the left, a yellow light beam shines towards a white wall with two narrow horizontal slits. Circular yellow waves emanate from each slit, spreading out and overlapping.\n\nThese waves hit a second white wall on the right. Here, a vertical pattern of alternating bright yellow and dark bands appears, showing the interference pattern. The central band is the brightest and widest yellow.",
