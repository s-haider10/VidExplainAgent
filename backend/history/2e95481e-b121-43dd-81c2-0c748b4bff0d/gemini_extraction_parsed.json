In the double slit experiment, laser light passes through two slits in a wall and spreads out like a wave as it passes through. The waves coming from each slit interfere with each other, creating a pattern of light and dark spots on a wall on the other side. This happens because when two crests or two troughs of a wave meet, they add together, but when a crest and a trough meet, they cancel out",

The waves interfere with each other, creating a complex pattern of intersecting arcs. These waves then hit a second white vertical wall on the right. On this second wall, a vertical pattern of alternating bright yellow and dark bands appears, representing the interference pattern.
