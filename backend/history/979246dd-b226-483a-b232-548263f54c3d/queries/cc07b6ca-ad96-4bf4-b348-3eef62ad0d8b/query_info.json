      "raw_visuals": "Two 3x3 matrices are shown side-by-side: a purple one `[[0, -2, 2], [5, 1, 5], [1, 4, -1]]` (labeled 'Second transformation') and a colored one `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]` (labeled 'First transformation'). A 3D grid then appears and undergoes a transformation corresponding to the 'First transformation'. Then, the transformed grid undergoes a second transformation corresponding to the 'Second transformation', showing the composition of two transformations. The grid deforms significantly, highlighting how complex transformations can be built from simpler ones.",

      "raw_transcript": "Multiplying two matrices is also similar. Whenever you see two 3x3 matrices getting multiplied together, you should imagine first applying the transformation encoded by the right one, then applying the transformation encoded by the left one. It turns out that 3D matrix multiplication is actually pretty important for fields like computer graphics and robotics, since things like rotations in three dimensions can be pretty hard to describe, but they're easier to wrap your mind around if you can break them down as the composition of separate, easier to think about rotations.",

      "raw_transcript": "Performing this matrix multiplication numerically is, once again, pretty similar to the two-dimensional case. In fact, a good way to test your understanding of the last video would be to try to reason through what specifically this matrix multiplication should look like, thinking closely about how it relates to the idea of applying two successive transformations in space."

The input vector is expressed as a linear combination `x * i-hat + y * j-hat + z * k-hat` using the original basis vectors. This is visually represented by the three scaled basis vectors (now pink, green, and light blue arrows) adding up to form the input vector. The transformation is then applied: x scales the first column, y scales the second, and z scales the third. The sum of these scaled columns forms the output vector. The visual animation shows the scaled original basis vectors moving to their transformed positions, then summing up to form the transformed output vector."
