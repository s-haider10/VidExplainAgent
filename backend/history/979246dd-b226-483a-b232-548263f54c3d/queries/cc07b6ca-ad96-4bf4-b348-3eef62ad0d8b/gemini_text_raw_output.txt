Matrix-matrix multiplication is visually shown as a composition of two successive transformations on a 3D grid (00:03:29).

Here's how it's depicted:
1.  Two 3x3 matrices are presented side-by-side, labeled 'First transformation' (the right matrix) and 'Second transformation' (the left matrix).
2.  A 3D grid first undergoes the transformation encoded by the 'First transformation' matrix.
3.  Immediately following this, the already transformed 3D grid then undergoes a second transformation, which is encoded by the 'Second transformation' matrix.
4.  The final deformed grid represents the result of applying both transformations in sequence, illustrating how matrix multiplication combines these transformations into one (00:03:29, 00:04:04).
