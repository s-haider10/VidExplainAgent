Graphically, the yellow axes with basis vectors are shown, and a pink input vector is constructed by scaling and adding the basis vectors.

It turns out that 3D matrix multiplication is actually pretty important for fields like computer graphics and robotics, since things like rotations in three dimensions can be pretty hard to describe, but they're easier to wrap your mind around if you can break them down as the composition of separate, easier-to-think-about rotations.",
