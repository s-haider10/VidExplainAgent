A matrix `[[3, 1], [1, 2]]` representing a transformation is at the top-left, and an input vector `[[-1], [2]]` is beside it. As the speaker explains, the grid transforms from a square grid to a sheared parallelogram grid, and the input vector `[[-1], [2]]` (representing -1 times the green basis vector plus 2 times the red basis vector) transforms into an output vector `[[3], [1]]` (which is drawn on the transformed grid). The input components '-1' and '2' appear next to the scaled basis vectors before they are added. The grid then resets to the untransformed state.",
      "raw_transcript": "In the last two videos, I talked about linear transformations and matrices, but I only showed the specific case of transformations that take two-dimensional vectors to other two-dimensional vectors. In general, throughout this series, we'll work mainly in two dimensions, mostly because it's easier to actually see on the screen and wrap your mind around."

Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to scale each basis vector so that they add together to get your vector. And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works both before and after the transformation.",

The individual scaled basis vectors (red, green, light blue) are shown, then added vectorially to form the input vector (pink). Then, the *transformed* scaled basis vectors are shown (each basis vector is transformed first, then scaled by x, y, or z), which then sum up to form the transformed output vector. The matrix multiplication `x * (first column) + y * (second column) + z * (third column)` is shown on screen, resulting in the output vector.",

But now, there are three standard basis vectors that we typically use: the unit vector in the X direction, I hat; the unit vector in the Y direction, J hat; and a new guy, the unit vector in the Z direction, called K hat. In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following those basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kind of messy.",
