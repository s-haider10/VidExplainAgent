In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following those basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kind of messy. By leaving a copy of the original axes in the background, we can think about the coordinates of where each of these three basis vectors lands.

And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works both before and after the transformation. So to see where your vector lands, you multiply those coordinates by the corresponding columns of the matrix, and then you add together the three results.",
