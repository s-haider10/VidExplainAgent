      "raw_transcript": "To see where a vector with coordinates X Y Z lands, the reasoning is almost identical to what it was for two dimensions. Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to scale each basis vector so that they add together to get your vector. And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works both before and after the transformation. So to see where your vector lands, you multiply those coordinates by the corresponding columns of the matrix, and then you add together the three results.",

The i-hat, j-hat, and k-hat vectors are scaled by x, y, and z respectively, and then added graphically to form the pink input vector. Then the transformed basis vectors (from the previous example, rotated around Y-axis) are shown scaled by x, y, and z, and then added to form the final transformed pink vector. On the black screen, the matrix `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]` (labeled 'Transformation') is shown next to the input vector `[[x], [y], [z]]` (labeled 'Input vector'). The multiplication is broken down: `x` times the first column, `y` times the second, `z` times the third, all added together to form the 'Output vector'.",

An input vector `[[-1], [2]]` is also shown. The vectors are animated as they are scaled by -1 and 2 respectively, showing their sum as a yellow vector, and then the transformed vector appears. The grid lines shear and stretch, demonstrating a linear transformation. This sequence repeats with the grid starting from a rectangular shape, then deforming, and finally returning to rectangular.",

In general, throughout this series, we'll work mainly in two dimensions, mostly because it's easier to actually see on the screen and wrap your mind around.",
