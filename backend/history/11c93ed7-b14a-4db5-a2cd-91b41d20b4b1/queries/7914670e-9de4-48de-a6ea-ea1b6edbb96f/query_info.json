The 3D grid animation from earlier (a rotation around the Y-axis, then another transformation) plays, visually representing the sequential application of the transformations encoded by the two matrices."

      "raw_transcript": "Performing this matrix multiplication numerically is, once again, pretty similar to the two-dimensional case. In fact, a good way to test your understanding of the last video would be to try to reason through what specifically this matrix multiplication should look like, thinking closely about how it relates to the idea of applying two successive transformations in space.",

A visualization shows an input vector (purple arrow) being constructed from scaled versions of the original basis vectors (red, green, light blue). Then, the transformation is applied to the basis vectors, and the *scaled* transformed basis vectors are shown adding together to form the transformed output vector (white arrow), demonstrating linearity.",

Each of those coordinates can be thought of as instructions for how to scale each basis vector, so that they add together to get your vector. And the important part, just like the 2D case, is that this scaling and adding process works both before and after the transformation.",
