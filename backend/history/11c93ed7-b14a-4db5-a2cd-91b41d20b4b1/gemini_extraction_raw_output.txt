But now, there are three standard basis vectors that we typically use: the unit vector in the X direction, I hat, the unit vector in the Y direction, J hat, and a new guy, the unit vector in the Z direction, called K hat. In fact, I think it's easier to think about these transformations by only following those basis vectors, since the full 3D grid representing all points can get kinda messy. By leaving a copy of the original axes in the background, we can think about the coordinates of where each of these three basis vectors lands. Record the coordinates of these three vectors as the columns of a 3x3 matrix. This gives a matrix that completely describes the transformation, using only nine numbers.",

For each transformed basis vector, its new coordinates are shown as a column vector next to it: i-hat transforms to `[[1],[0],[-1]]`, j-hat to `[[1],[1],[0]]`, and k-hat to `[[1],[0],[1]]`.

Those three sets of coordinates become the columns of a matrix that describes that rotation transformation.",
